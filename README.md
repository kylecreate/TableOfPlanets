# Table of Planets Project

[MDN Structuring Tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Structuring_planet_data)

## Project Brief
You are working at a school; currently your students are studying the planets of our solar system, and you want to provide them with an easy-to-follow set of data to look up facts and figures about the planets. An HTML data table would be ideal — you need to take the raw data you have available and turn it into a table, following the steps below.

### Steps to complete
- [x] Open your copy of blank-template.html, and start the table off by giving it an outer container, a table header, and a table body. You don't need a table footer for this example.

- [x] Add the provided caption to your table.

- [x] Add a row to the table header containing all the column headers.

- [x] Create all the content rows inside the table body, remembering to make all the row headings into headings semantically.

- [x] Ensure all the content is placed into the right cells — in the raw data, each row of planet data is shown next to its associated planet.

- [x] Add attributes to make the row and column headers unambiguously associated with the rows, columns, or rowgroups that they act as headings for.

- [x] Add a black border just around the column that contains all the planet name row headers.
